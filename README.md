I'm currently working on SC IIC on position SA. More precisely t is called as "information technology specialist".<br>
By facts my job is a coctail from anykey's operation, SA, DBA, electrician and a litlle bit more... ))<br>
Big number of directions of my job is a curse and blessing at the same time: I cannot deep in any thing but know a more about all.<br><br>
