Hi tnere!

My name Hafarov Dmytro.
I'm currently working on SC IIC on position SA. More precisely t is called as "information technology specialist".
By facts my job is a coctail from anykey's operation, SA, DBA, electrician and a litlle bit more... ))
Big number of directions of my job is a curse and blessing at the same time: I cannot deep in any thing but know a more about all.
